# Information

Originally started as a fork from [Quackster/Kepler](https://github.com/Quackster/Kepler), this is a server created in Java designed to revive Habbo Hotel v31 from the 2009 era and its inception was in early 2018 as a side project. Havana is the most complete v31+ server to date, this was undertaken by various reverse engineering efforts of the Shockwave client throughout the years to achieve this.

Havana has been an independent project, almost entirely developed by [myself](https://github.com/Quackster) for 4 years straight. This project means a lot to me, and was always going to be released as open-source work. I am a firm believer in open-source and free software for everybody.

Sulake used the Adobe/Macromedia Shockwave as its multimedia platform for their game (Habbo Hotel) from 2001-2009. In the last year, Habbo made the move to the Adobe Flash client, and then in 2020 made the switch to the Unity engine, while still maintaining their flash client.

Nowadays, the Shockwave client cannot be played in modern browsers as they have removed NPAPI support due to deprecation, end of life support and therefore must be played on forks of browsers that still have the NPAPI enabled.

The reason why Shockwave emulators exist is for multiple reasons, the first is that Habbo uses a virtual currency called credits which is spent using real money and makes it a pay to win game, our own faithful recreation of Habbo can make credits free for everybody. The second is the fact that modern Habbo still lacks features that were once available to the users that played during the Shockwave-era - and is thus, to be intended to be used for **educational purposes only** as a preservation effort for an old game.

# Download

Download the latest development build from the [releases page](https://github.com/Quackster/Havana/releases).

### Requirements

To be honest, this server doesn't require much. I'd argue that the MariaDB server is more resource demanding than the emulator itself. 

- JDK >= 17
- MariaDB server
- At minimum 4 GB of RAM (to be safe)

If you aim to use this for yourself, I recommend setting up your own 2009 figure image renderer with the project I've created [here](https://github.com/Quackster/Minerva) called **Minerva** to render figures and badges on the website.

You run Minerva as a seperate instance, once it is running, take note how it listens on ``http://localhost:5000/``. The setting in the Havana ``settings`` table ``site.imaging.endpoint`` called has this variable set by default with that value already, so you should be good to go already with all badges and figures working as they should.

# Installation

Install MariaDB server, connect to the database server and import havana.sql (located in /tools/havana.sql).

Download the latest development build from the [releases page](https://github.com/Quackster/Havana/releases) and rename the files to remove the short build hash version, for convenience. 

Install any JDK version that is equal or above >= 17 to run the jar files.

Run both Havana-Server.jar and Havana-Web.jar at least once to generate the necessary configuration files, configure the MySQL attributes to connect to the MariaDB server.

Download the [havana_www_10_09_2024.7z](https://www.mediafire.com/file/xzjfsvb3k2962xo/havana_www_10_09_2024.7z/file) file, and then extract it to /tools/www/ this directory is located where you ran Havana-Web.jar. 

*(This is the default directory for static content within the Havana-Web project, but the directory where it looks for static images can be configured in the Housekeeping settings).*

Start Havana-Web via start_web.sh (Unix/Linux distros) or start_web.bat (Windows)

Start Havana-Server via start_server.sh (Unix/Linux distros) or start_server.bat (Windows)

Your server should be up and running and accessible via http://localhost/

❗ Once registered as an admin, I high recommend running [groups.sql](https://github.com/Quackster/Havana/blob/master/tools/groups.sql) against your database, it will create the Habbo Guides, SnowStorm, BattleBall, Wobble Squabble and Lido Diving gaming groups for the website.

And then make yourself admin by setting your ``rank`` to 8 in the ``users`` table.

### Important for Linux users

Install the font manager, to enable the captcha to work on the website.

```
apt-get install font-manager
```

# Quick start using Docker

Install Docker, update ``docker-compose.yaml`` to use strong passwords for MariaDB.

❗ Variables values between ``x-mariadb-variables`` and ``x-havana-variables`` must match if you edit usernames and passwords.

Download the [havana_www_28_07_2024.zip](https://www.mediafire.com/file/6kn4ghtb37lfc1p/havana_www_28_07_2024.zip/file) file, and then extract it to tools/www/ this directory is located in the repository you just cloned.

Start the stack using ``docker-compose up``

You can access the MariaDB instance that is running in Docker on ``localhost:3306``

You can access Havana that is running in Docker on ``localhost:80``

Follow the instructions above for setting yourself as an admin.
