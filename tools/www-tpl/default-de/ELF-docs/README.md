# ELF | E.druids Localized Files

Between July 25 and August 3, 2025, all `.tpl` files of the Havana WebServer were translated from English into German.  
Minimal bugfixes, readability improvements, and attention to detail have been applied throughout all parts.

## Features

- Manually translated texts and descriptive labels
- Genuine localization: no machine translation, exclusively human refinement
- Careful handling of placeholders and possible error sources: `{...}`, `{{...}}`
- Cultural nuances considered to the best of my knowledge
- Minor bugfixes and simplified structures for improved maintainability

- Eine deutsche Version dieses Dokuments findest du in [Readme-de](README-de.md)
